The Hospital Management System (HMS) is a comprehensive relational database project developed using Python and SQLite3, designed to digitize and optimize hospital workflows while ensuring secure, scalable, and efficient management of critical operations. By leveraging Python’s sqlite3 library, the system establishes a lightweight yet powerful database that integrates patient information, doctor schedules, department structures, appointments, billing, pharmacy, medical records, and logistical support such as ambulances and inventory management into a unified platform. The HMS enables seamless interaction across hospital staff, allowing quick patient admission, dynamic allocation of medical resources, automated appointment scheduling, accurate billing with insurance integration, and real-time tracking of medical histories, stock availability, and service utilization. Entity relationships and foreign key constraints are implemented to maintain data integrity and support advanced queries for administrative, clinical, and support operations, while Python scripts handle CRUD operations, automate workflows, and generate analytical reports. This combination of Python and SQLite3 ensures portability, simplicity, and reliability, making HMS an ideal solution for hospitals seeking to modernize their processes without the overhead of complex server-based databases.
